Goal
    Discover any correlation between Math grades and Computer Science grades.
    Upon finding this correlation we will train an AI model to be able to predict what a student's Computer Science grades should be based on how well they have done in math throughout their education. (<- define 'throughout their education' better once we get the data)

Objectives
    1. Get data from Professor Li
    2. Clean the data and deal with any missing values or outliers
    3. Analyze data and generate summary statistics
    4. Determine any correlation between math grades and cs grades
    5. Set up an AI model to be trained on this data (set aside 20% of the data to be used as testing data)
    6. Train the model
    7. Test the model
    8. Deploy the model.
